We want to know how successful different campaigns were, looking at launch dates and funding goals. This project looks at data from Kickstarter to predic the best time of year and funding goals to set to successfuly fund Theater/play projects.   

## Analysis and Challenges

A Kickstarter where the money pledged was equal to or higher than the goal funding amount is considered successful; conversly, a campaign where the money pledged was less than the goal amount is considered failed.
